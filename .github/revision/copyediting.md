## Punctuation
 - [ ] Always capitalize WordPress correctly.
 - [ ] Do not capitalize regular nouns. All WordPress elements as regular nouns: themes, post, or user.
 - [ ] Capitalise the names of pages, links, plugins and buttons: the Save button, or the Posts page.
 - [ ] Quotation marks (“) should be used only for direct quotes and the titles of documents and web pages.
 - [ ] Backticks (`) should be used to indicate a command, a file name, or something the user needs to type.
 - [ ] Use a colon (:) to introduce a list when it is preceded by a full sentence. Do not use a colon otherwise, even if you are introducing a bulleted list.
 - [ ] Use the Oxford comma, which means including the final comma before and, or or in a list: “apples, oranges, and bananas” and not “apple, oranges and bananas.”

## Grammar
 - [ ] Written in an informal but knowledgeable manner, the reader should feel that this is a friend explaining something clearly to them.
 - [ ] Second person, using “you” not “we”, and addressing the reader as though they were sitting beside you.
 - [ ] Avoid jargon, abbreviations, acronyms, or capitalizations. If you need to use any of these always write the full expanded or explained version the first time, followed by the shortened version in parenthesis (brackets). For example, “use the General Public License (GPL).”
 - [ ] Avoid slang words, cultural references, or idioms
